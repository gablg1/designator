\begin{block}{Introduction}
Over the past decade, aesthetics have gained a lot of importance in the decisions companies
make in how they design websites, and user experience is at the core of this trend. One way to
automate part of the creative process of web design is to generate suggestions based on what
popular similar websites contain that the input website does not yet have. Finding "similar
websites," however, can prove to be a daunting task, since diffing a screenshot or even the
color histogram of a given input website against thousands or millions of other websites in a
database is unfeasibly slow. This paper applies Affinity Propagation, an unsupervised clustering
technique, to solve this problem. Once the website database is clustered, the system can place
any input website into a specific cluster. Diffing the input against all websites in a cluster can be
done much faster than within the whole database, and the system will only have to consider
recommendations that are relevant to that specific cluster.
